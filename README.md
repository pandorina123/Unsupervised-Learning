### Clustering - Unsupervised learning

This project compares and discusses the clustering of the Height and Weight features to segregate male and female respondents. It experiments with two popular clustering techniques: **k-means** and **agglomerative clustering** with three different linkages.

## Techniques Used
1. **K-means Clustering**
2. **Agglomerative Clustering** (with three different linkages: single, complete, and ward linkage)

## Evaluation Metrics
- **Silhouette Score**: Used to measure how similar each point is to its own cluster compared to other clusters.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Helps evaluate how accurately the clusters align with actual groupings.

## How to Run
1. Load the dataset containing the Height and Weight features.
2. Apply both k-means and agglomerative clustering techniques.
3. Evaluate the clustering results using the silhouette score and confusion matrix.
4. Compare and analyze the outcomes to determine the more effective clustering method.
